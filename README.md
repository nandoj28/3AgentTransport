# 3 Agent Transport

## Overview
This project implements a grid world simulation where agents operate within a grid, performing actions like moving, picking up, and dropping off items based on reinforcement learning algorithms. It is designed to showcase how agents learn and make decisions using policies such as random, greedy, and exploit within a simulated environment.

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes several libraries:
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and matrix operations efficiently.
- **OpenCV**: Used for creating and manipulating the visual representation of the grid world.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting data, particularly the Q-values from the learning process.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, then use pip to install the required libraries. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
```

## Run Program:
to run program
```bash
python3 main.py
```
